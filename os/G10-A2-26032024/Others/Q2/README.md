# Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This C program generates the fibonacci sequence with length of a given positive integer. The fibonacci sequence is generated by

- First 2 numbers in fibonacci sequence 0 , 1
- sequence[index] = sequence[index -1] + sequence[index -1]


The program uses a thread to generate the sequence for the given input number.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler:

   ```bash
   gcc fibonacci.c -o fib -pthread
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./fib
   ```

3. Follow the prompt to enter a positive integer.

4. The program will generate and print the Fibonacci sequence with the given length.

## Example

```bash
Enter a number for fibonacci sequence: 6
Fibnoacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5
```

## Notes

- The program uses a loop to ensure that the user enters a positive integer.
- The thread generates the Fibonacci sequence for the entered integer and stores it into the sequence array
