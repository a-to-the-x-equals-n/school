# Collatz Conjecture Sequence Generator

This C program generates the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer. The Collatz sequence is generated by repeatedly applying the following rules to the current number:

- If the current number is even, divide it by 2.
- If the current number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

The program uses a forked child process to calculate the sequence for the given input number.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler:

   ```bash
   gcc seq.c -o seq
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./seq
   ```

3. Follow the prompt to enter a positive integer.

4. The program will generate and print the Collatz sequence for the entered integer.

## Example

```bash
Please enter a positive integer: 6
Child process: 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
Parent Process: Child process ended
```

## Notes

- The program uses a loop to ensure that the user enters a positive integer.
- The child process calculates and prints the Collatz sequence for the entered integer.
- The parent process waits for the child process to finish before printing a completion message.
