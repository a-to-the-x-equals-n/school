		My name's Logan and I am 36 years old.
		I just graduated with my bachelors in cs last semester.
		I was fortunate enough to be accepted into the accelerated masters program, and now I am finish up my last two semesters for my grad degree.
		I'm a veteran, a husband, and a father of two.
		Before I decided to return to school, I was in the restaurant industry for about 10 years.
		The industry itself is very intense and physically demanding.  Eventually I got tired of coming home exhausted and not being able to be adequately present as a father or husband.
		So I gave it all, put in my notice, and decided to use my GI Bill and go to school to pursue something else.
		Since I was already pretty native with the professional market, I made sure to do my due diligence and research job markets that had really high employee growth --
		and of course -- fairly high salaries. Thanks for reading!
