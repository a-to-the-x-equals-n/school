A probability function, P(), returns the probability of a
feature taking a specific value.

A joint probability refers to the probability of an
assignment of specific values to multiple different features.

A conditional probability refers to the probability of one
feature taking a specific value given that we already know
the value of a different feature

A probability distribution is a data structure that
describes the probability of each possible value a feature
can take. The sum of a probability distribution must equal
1.0.
